# Code of ethics for development
- Always communicate. Always be online on Slack.
- Always check the list of tasks in our Jira workspace, or Trello Board.
- Make sure all the requirements for a sprint is completed before starting a sprint.
- Always check the `Product Requirements Document`. If there are confusing part, ask the `product owner`.
- Use our [Story Points Reference](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1d0NXGroIpStZZtTgpfWG5JEk1T97xBEqSRX60pIs2WE/edit#gid=0) in estimating a task/ticket weight.
- Always work with a Pull Request. Long running PRs are welcome but mark them with [WIP] so we don't merge it.
- Follow the git flow principles.
- We always work with a Milestone.
- Always get your PR code reviewed by somebody else. Please do not self-merge unless seriously needed (hotfix)
- Always keep your PR up to date. Rebase frequently.
- We love reasons and we want every PR to have a reason tell us the story on how you tackle a problem or implemented your new solution.
- Follow [PSR-1](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-1/) and [PSR-2](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-2/) for PHP.
- Follow [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) best practices for Python.
- Read and follow most of the [Zen of Python](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/)
- Follow [AIRBNB's javascript style guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript) for web javascript.
- Always follow the TDD Principle `Write a Failing Test -> Implement -> Refactor -> Repeat` an 80% test coverage is good, 90% is super good and a 100% is "GodLike".
- If you can't immediately write a test for a method, make sure to still write a test case and just put pending explain the reason why so you or somebody else can return to it later.
- Be consistent with other people's way of doing things but feel free to discuss improvements.
- We put more weight in code clarity.
- Make use of special ANNOTATIONS like # TODO:, FIXME:, OPTIMIZE: so IDE can pick up.
- Prevent being a blocker to your teammates.
- We chose to be Proactive over Reactive.
- Always learn and share. Everyone is free to learn new things, we don't tolerate the `fear of mistakes`, we want everyone to learn from their mistakes and become better.
- Always put this `code of ethics` document on the project `README` document


# To sum it all up:
- Communicate
- Learn
- Share
